## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

3. **Forms MUST submit** - Test Supabase integration
4. **Email confirmations MUST send** - Immediate response expected
5. **Print quality MUST be premium** - Reflects your brand
6. **Event date MUST be in offer** - Create urgency

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Printing QR codes before landing pages are ready

❌ Too much text (people won't read it)
❌ No clear CTA (what should they do?)
❌ No tracking (how do you measure success?)
