**Option 2: Hand Delivery**
- Hire 2-3 people for 3 days

- Cost: ₹2,000/person/day × 3 people × 3 days = ₹18,000
- More targeted, can qualify leads on spot

**Option 3: Event Organizer Network**

- Cost: Included in sponsorship or small fee

**Option 4: Partner Distribution**
- Partner with complementary businesses (accounting firms, legal services)
